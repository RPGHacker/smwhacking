# smwhacking.de
**smwhacking.de** is a German-language website dedicated to Super Mario World ROM hacking. It includes a reasonably fully-featured forum and a basic AJAX chat.

The site has been around since 2008 in some form or another. Before I wrote this version, it used to consist of a static website and a phpBB forum, which some of the code and the features are still tailored around.

Save for a few third-party libraries, this site was written completely from scratch! Making my own forum software was always a bit of a dream of mine. (You be the judge if I succeeded or not.)

I'd be surprised if this software didn't contain any emberrassing bugs or glaring security issues. If you come across one, let me know in whatever way you like.
